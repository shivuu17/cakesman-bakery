## 🆘 IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

**Products not loading?**
- Check MongoDB Atlas cluster is running
- Verify MONGO_URI in Railway
- Check Railway logs for connection errors

**Can't login?**
- Check backend is running in Railway
- Verify JWT_SECRET is same in Railway env vars
- Check Vercel logs for API errors

**CORS errors?**
- This is expected if backend URL is wrong
- Update REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL in Vercel
- Wait for redeploy to complete
