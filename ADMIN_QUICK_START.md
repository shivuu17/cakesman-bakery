## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Demo Mode
Currently using **mock data** (no database):
- Products stored in React state
- Changes lost on page refresh
- Not persistent

### For Production
You'll need to:
1. Replace mock data with API calls
2. Connect to real database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
3. Implement proper authentication (JWT, OAuth)
4. Add image upload functionality
5. Add server-side validation

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Admin Dashboard Not Loading
- Check if you're logged in as admin
- Verify URL is `http://localhost:3000/admin`
- Check browser console for errors
- Try clearing localStorage and re-logging in

### Can't Login as Admin
- Verify credentials:
  - Email: `admin@cakesman.com`
  - Password: `admin123`
- Check if localStorage is enabled
- Try incognito/private mode

### Changes Not Saving
- This is normal - currently using mock data
- Changes only persist during current session
- Page refresh will reset to original data

### Products Not Showing
- Check if you're on the correct route (`/admin`)
- Verify backend is running (for future API integration)
- Check browser console for errors

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Test all features** - Try adding, editing, deleting products
2. **Test navigation** - Go to home page and back
3. **Test logout** - Verify you're redirected to home
4. **Test customer login** - Ensure it still works
5. **Review responsive design** - Check on mobile
