Counting objects: 100% (XX/XX), done.
...
To https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Cakesman-Bakery.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
```

NODE_ENV=production
```

### 3.4 Get Your Backend URL
- After deployment, Railway shows URL like:
  ```
  https://cakesman-bakery-backend-production.railway.app
  ```
- Copy this URL (you'll need it next)

---

## STEP 4: Setup MongoDB Atlas (Production Database)

### 4.1 Create MongoDB Account

  ```
- Replace `PASSWORD` with your database user password
- Add `/cakesman` to end (database name)

### 4.6 Update Railway Environment Variable

## STEP 5: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

### 5.1 Create Vercel Account
- Go to: https://vercel.com
- Click "Sign Up"
- Choose "GitHub" option
- Authorize and complete signup

### 5.2 Deploy Frontend
- In Vercel Dashboard: "Add New" > "Project"
- Select your `Cakesman-Bakery` repository
- Framework: Select "React"
- Root Directory: Select `frontend`
- Click "Deploy"

### 5.3 Add Environment Variables
- Go to Project Settings > Environment Variables
- Add:
  ```
  Name: REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL
  Value: https://your-railway-backend-url/api
  ```
  (Replace with your actual Railway URL from Step 3.4)
- Save

### 5.4 Redeploy
- Click "Deployments" > Latest deployment > "Redeploy"

### 5.5 Get Your Frontend URL
- After deployment, Vercel shows URL like:
  ```
  https://cakesman-bakery.vercel.app
  ```

---

## STEP 6: Verify Deployment

### Test Frontend
1. Open: https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app
2. Should see homepage with products
3. Try adding items to cart
4. Try logging in with: admin@cakesman.com / admin123

### Test Admin Dashboard
1. Open: https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/admin
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Try adding a new product

### Test Backend API
```powershell
# In PowerShell, run:
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://your-railway-url/api/products" -Method GET
$response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object -First 1
```

Should return product data.

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Products Not Loading
- Check if MongoDB connection is working
- Verify MONGO_URI in Railway environment variables
- Check Railway logs for errors

### Login Not Working
- Make sure backend API URL is correct in Vercel env vars
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify JWT_SECRET matches between frontend and backend

### CORS Errors
Update `backend/server.js` CORS settings:

```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: ["https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app", "http://localhost:3000"],
  credentials: true
}));
```

Then redeploy backend.

## AFTER DEPLOYMENT

### Making Updates

# Make changes locally
# ...edit files...

# Commit and push
cd d:\Cakesman-Bakery
git add .
git commit -m "Your change description"
git push origin main
```

Both Vercel and Railway will automatically redeploy! 🚀

### Manage Products
